As [Newton said](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants) : "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants". So if you consider my projects helpful, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants — in the open source community.

My software motto is "Simple by default, powerful when needed".

__User experience__ of my software should be __seamless__, __intuitive__ and __fun__.

For my __developer experience__, I tend to use _fewer dependencies_, I prefer _locality_ of functionality more than clean code in too many files, I tend to create _simpler UI_ for my sanity.
